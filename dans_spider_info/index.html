# My presentation about spiders 
## By Daniel Wyatt 3SL

## most poisonous 
The Daddy Long leg Spider is the most poisonous Spider in the world
And here's an interesting fact:
The Daddy long leg spider's jaws aren't big enough to bite humans!

---
## Tarantulas 
Tarantulas weigh from 1 to 3 ounces and their length goes from 11 . 4 to 28 centimeters!

---
## Liquid-like insides (venom) 
once a spider injects the venom ,the thing it injected the venom into, their insides turns into liquid.
