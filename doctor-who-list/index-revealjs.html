<h2>Summary - Season 1 (William Hartnell)</h2>
<p>This is a show trying to find its feet. Is it an ensemble show, or is
the main character the mysterious man billed in the credits (really) as
“Dr. Who”? Is it an educational children’s history show or a scifi
horror drama? It’s all of those things! So many classic moments which
still work, from the first scenes in An Unearthly Child to the grim
moral dilemma of The Aztecs. If you’re up for it, it’s also totally
possible to start the show at the beginning.</p>
</section>
<section id="an-unearthly-child---watch" class="slide level2">
<h2>An Unearthly Child - Watch</h2>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>I’d watch the first (superb) episode of the serial - which is eerie
and strange - The Twilight Zone meets Narnia, but the rest is very
cheesy and painfully dated. Skip all of that and go on to good
stuff.</p>
<p>Story 1; 4 episodes - An Unearthly Child</p>
</section>
<section id="the-daleks---watch" class="slide level2">
<h2>The Daleks - Watch</h2>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A decent introduction to the Doctor’s most iconic enemies. There’s a
lot of filler later on though. If I were being honest, this is more of a
“maybe,” but from a history-of-the-show viewpoint, it is iconic. If
nothing else, watch the unsettling first Dalek cliffhanger and the
brutal first full appearance of the monsters.</p>

</section>
<section id="the-edge-of-destruction---watch" class="slide level2">
<h2>The Edge of Destruction - Watch</h2>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A tight, paranoid 45 minute drama inside the TARDIS - worth seeing.
This is also a turning point for the Doctor, who until this point has
been cold and withdrawn.</p>
<p>All of this seven-episode serial is lost, which is a terrible shame -
the reconstructed version makes it seem like this would have been
visually spectacular. The story itself is interesting and epic in scope,
but it meanders in the middle and ultimately, not enough happens to
justify its length (or at least, not enough to seek out a
reconstruction).</p>
<p>Not bad - a sequence of adventures from Terry Nation - but not
exactly great either. A filler episode.</p>

<h2>The Aztecs - Watch</h2>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A really terrific, fascinating historical episode which lets the

interfere in history? Barbara takes it on herself to try. Best of the
First Doctor, in my humble opinion.</p>

<h2>The Sensorites - Skip</h2>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A few nice moments, but it’s largely tedious and too long. Do,
however, watch Susan give us our first description of the Time Lords’
home planet. And here’s a nice scene as the group reflect on their
adventures.</p>

<h2>The Reign of Terror (episodes 4 - 5 missing) - Maybe</h2>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>If you’re willing to endure a few reconstructed episodes, this is a
good, dark serial where our heroes have to stay alive in the French
Revolution. The Doctor ponces about in a plumed hat, which is worth the
price of admission. It inspired this tweet, which I’m proud of.</p>

<p>The second season is a bit more pedestrian, but still has fine

avuncular and twinkly in the lead role.</p>

</section>
<section id="the-romans---watch" class="slide level2">
<h2>The Romans - Watch</h2>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>It’s a fun, dorky historical and Ian spends a lot of time in a toga,
so it comes highly recommended from me. Also the First Doctor
accidentally ends up swept up on a journey that leads him to the court
of Nero himself where he has to engage in “the gentle art of
fisticuffs.” Clearly, the Doctor is starting to take a more proactive
role in the story.</p>

<h2>The Web Planet - Skip</h2>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>It’s not awful, but between some really weird stylistic choices
(Vaseline on the camera lens?) and a fairly slow plot, it’s pretty
skippable. I do love the weird character designs and movements, though -
props for ambition, ambition for props.</p>

<p>A terrific historical, which is compelling despite the two missing

Marsh as his sister Joanna - the two have extraordinary chemistry. It
all just works.</p>

definitely need to see.)</p>

</section>
<section id="the-time-meddler---maybe" class="slide level2">
<h2>The Time Meddler - Maybe</h2>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A bit slow, but this is the first Time Lord we meet who isn’t related
to the Doctor (and with his own TARDIS), so that’s pretty cool. It’s a
neat medieval milieu as well.</p>

<section id="summary---season-3-william-hartnell" class="slide level2">
<h2>Summary - Season 3 (William Hartnell)</h2>
<p>An uneven season which grows stronger as it progresses, and shoots
for the moon with the ambitious epic The Daleks’ Master Plan. The Doctor
really starts to contemplate his losses and the weight of his traveling.
Hartnell is also much stronger here - his health is still not what it
was, but he’s certainly not flubbing lines as often as he was in season
2.</p>

it for the long periods waiting for robots - “Chumblies” - to trundle

watch it here.</p>

<h2>The Myth Makers (all episodes missing) - Skip</h2>
<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>Just kill me now. This story was probably pretty entertaining when it
could be seen, as the Doctor gets mistaken for Zeus at the siege of Troy
and that had to be fun, but it’s a chore to listen to tons and tons of
exposition in still pictures. The third episode picks up a bit, but it’s
all too brief. It also helps to be familiar with Greek mythology - or
rather, Shakespeare - as it turns out (spoiler!) Cressida and Diomedes
were actually Vicki and Steven. Vicki - I mean, Cressida - ends up
falling for Troilus and that’s how she leaves the TARDIS. Meanwhile,
Trojan maid Katarina joins the TARDIS team.</p>

<p>A dark, immense tale which does what The Chase wanted to do, but
better. It’s a bit bloated, but it also doesn’t shy away from some real
consequences for the Doctor, and William Hartnell has seldom been
better. A magnificent epic. Do, however, skip The Feast of Steven, which
is a Christmas filler episode that my sister aptly described as “one
long headache.”</p>

<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>The story’s a little bit hard to follow in a reconstruction, but the
ending is serious and thoughtful, as Steven grapples with the realities
of non-interference in history. If nothing else, you have to watch that
ending, which is really excellent drama - and which melds into a
Hartnell monologue with near David Tennant levels of Doctor Pathos. Also
- hahahaha - he totally kidnaps Dodo because she reminds him of
Susan.</p>

<p>A gonzo ride into the mind of the Celestial Toymaker, a god who
forces his captives - in this case, the Doctor, Steven, and Dodo - to
play a series of nonsense games or be trapped in his universe for
eternity. It’s interesting and, for those days, high concept. Slightly
overrated, yes (season 6’s The Mind Robber is the platonic ideal of this
type of tale), but it’s a neat story.</p>

long and they repeat the earworm theme song every three minutes. I don’t

<p>Alas, there’s nothing left of this episode, which is a shame, because
it’s an interesting morality tale in which the Doctor gets to be
thunderingly righteous in the aid of an oppressed minority people. He
even talks about human beings in terms of souls, which makes his
argument all the stronger.</p>

<p>The last complete Hartnell episode. It’s an okay story, introducing
new companions Ben and Polly and providing an exit for Dodo Chaplet.
Kind of forgettable otherwise, though. Polly is the best female
companion we’ve had since Barbara. Watch her meet Ben here, to get an
idea of their personalities.</p>

<h2>Summary - Season 4 (William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton)</h2>
<p>It’s happening! William Hartnell’s increasingly frail health prompts
the BBC to find a way to recast the lead in their hit series.
Remarkably, instead of casting a William Hartnell lookalike, they decide
to go with Patrick Troughton, an impish little man with a Beatles moptop
and a twinkle in his eye that may be friendly or may be cunning. He’s
certainly not the man we knew, and he’s not interested in holding our
hand through the craziness of the first regeneration.</p>

<p>Not the most exciting plot, but it’s the introduction of a key

and the occasion of the first regeneration. I’d say essential, but since
it’s harder to get a hold of, I guess not. Still, it’s a big moment in

<p>It’s worth watching a reconstruction (I always prefer the fan-made

The aliens have an interesting motivation for stealing “faces.” It’s

Still, the first fully complete Patrick Troughton episode shows him at
the height of his charms alongside his best companion, Jamie. We get a
magical “bigger on the inside” scene and one of Troughton’s greatest

so slow and sinister that they end up becoming a bit boring, and
Victoria is back to her old screamer ways (seriously, one week she’s

paced, this is the rare reconstruction which kept me on the edge of my
seat throughout (I watched Loose Canon’s reconstruction but I might
actually look into getting the animated version). In addition to all its
other charms, it has a great emotional arc for Victoria as she starts to

<p>It’s the introduction of young genius companion Zoe Heriot, but
there’s not enough here to make it worth watching. You do get this line:
“Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with authority.” And
Jamie coins the Doctor’s long-time alias, John Smith. Here’s Zoe meeting
the Doctor. And the Doctor welcomes Zoe on board with a little pleasant
hazing. Both of those clips are good to watch, and if you were wondering
how Jamie was taking Victoria’s exit, here’s a reconstruction of that
scene.</p>

<h2>Summary - Season 7 (Jon Pertwee)</h2>
<p>The Third Doctor’s first season brings Doctor Who into the marvelous
world of color. Jon Pertwee was primarily a comic actor, so it came as a
surprise to everyone (including him, a bit) when he played the role ” as
himself,” drawing on his background as a Naval Intelligence operative
during the war. He’s supported by a marvelous cast, including Nicholas
Courtenay as Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart (if you liked
Kate Stewart in New Who, this is her dad.) While I love the gentler side
he shows in later seasons, Pertwee may be at his best in his first
outing, still showing the immaturity and unpredictability which
characterized his predecessor’s “trickster” persona.</p>

also a really great regeneration episode (topped only by The Eleventh
Hour, in my opinion) which introduces the Doctor’s new milieu and sets
up the supporting cast who will anchor the show for its earthbound
years.</p>

much of it is spent with the Doctor or Jo sidelined for plot reasons
(he’s in a coma - but when he wakes up, he takes the time to switch
clothes before dealing with the immediate crisis) and the non-Dalek
villains clearly suffered from a lack of budget (they’re invisible). An
underbaked side romance for Jo just makes the story feel all the more

<h2>Summary - Season 15 (Tom Baker)</h2>
<p>Producer Philip Hinchcliffe leaves (alas), and with his departure the
show starts to transition to a more PG approach. Not everybody likes the
robot dog (Tom Baker certainly didn’t!) but there’s still a lot of good
to be found in this era.</p>

<p>With Leela departed, it’s time for yet another companion - and the
first season to try serialization, as Romana and the Doctor search for

up to the earlier heights of the Tom Baker era, this is a solid
collection of episodes.</p>

the first episode sidelines the Doctor and Peri for so long that the

<h2>Summary - Season 23 (Colin Baker)</h2>
<p>For Colin Baker’s second season, the writers decided to try for an
extremely experimental approach: one massive story framed by a trial.
The Doctor is on trial before the Time Lords, accused of genocide - the
first three episode are retrospective pieces of evidence presented by
the prosecution. All in all, the four episodes are known as Trial of a
Timelord:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mysterious Planet</li>
<li>Mindwarp</li>
<li>Terror of the Vervoids</li>
<li>The Ultimate Foe.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<p>Skip, Watch, or Maybe? This is tough. It’s a weird and high concept
series that still has some but not all of the problems of the previous
season. The Doctor is kinder. It’s an interesting, twisty plot - but it
does still have a lot of the same pitfalls, and I don’t point to any
part of it as definitively great. I’m gonna go with Maybe.</p>
<p>Here’s where I’m going to stop you and explain why I love the Sixth
Doctor so much. After the show was cancelled, a group of fans formed Big
Finish, a company which produced audio dramas set in the world of Doctor
Who. They turned in some of the most wonderful story-telling the show’s
world has received, and much of it influenced (and is still referenced
in) the revived show (remember the Eighth Doctor listing his companions?
That was Big Finish.) I recommend you head over to Spotify now and start
with The Marian Conspiracy, a wonderful introduction to his most
wonderful of companions, elderly history teacher Evelyn Smythe.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<p>Colin’s final story is The Last Adventure, in which he battles the
Valeyard. On the original show, Colin was fired and so Sylvester McCoy
regenerated with an obscured face and a blond wig. But The Last
Adventure ends with a re-written regeneration, segueing smoothly into
the opening of the next episode. Many fans have made animated versions
of that scene from the audio drama, but this deepfake one is the best,
giving Colin, finally, a decent send-off. (If you want something a bit
funnier, try this.)</p>
<p>Sylvester McCoy starts off with an absolute dump of a season. You can
probably skip to the next season safely, but check out the final scene
of Dragonfire, below.</p>

<h2>Delta and the Bannermen - Maybe</h2>
<p><sub>Season 23 (Colin Baker)</sub></p>
<p>Soooo this one is really weird and probably an episode most people
dislike, but I think it’s fun. The Doctor and Mel think they’re going to
1950s Disneyland, but they end up at a Welsh hotel which is the center
of a drama featuring several extraterrestrial visitors. It’s possible
that I liked it was because the rest of this season is dreadful, but
it’s the best of the early McCoy panto period for sure.</p>

<h2>Dragonfire - Skip</h2>
<p><sub>Season 23 (Colin Baker)</sub></p>
<p>The main reason to watch this is that it’s the exit for Mel and the
entry point for the first really good companion we’ve had for ages: Ace
McShane. The episode’s not great, but Mel’s goodbye is very good. McCoy
delivers a touching speech. Watch the goodbye and the speech here.</p>

<h2>Summary - Season 25 (Sylvester McCoy)</h2>
<p>Finally! The downward trend begins to reverse itself. The Seventh
Doctor has a great new companion and a show which seems to remember its
history and its dignity. No more panto. Mostly.</p>

<h2>Remembrance of the Daleks - Watch</h2>
<p><sub>Season 25 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
<p>The show reinvents itself. We have a new companion, a new tone, and
we might as well have a new Doctor, as Sylvester McCoy reveals the
Doctor’s dark side. Sylvester McCoy said at a convention I attended that
he based this shift in portrayal on his grandmother who lived to over
100 - that “weariness” and age is something he tries to convey - and
succeeds beautifully.</p>

<h2>The Happiness Patrol - Watch</h2>
<p><sub>Season 25 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
<p>I once saw a clip from this episode and was utterly horrified at the
depths of camp to which 80’s Doctor Who had sunk. But when I actually
got around to watching it…it’s good. The story is set in a futuristic,
fascist society where no one is allowed to be sad. There’s also…the
Kandy Man, who looks like a children’s show character, but who is, with
his high reedy voice and horrifying ways of killing people, an
unexpected success as a villain. So is Helen A. - the society’s dictator
(based on Margaret Thatcher, but that wasn’t obvious to me as a modern
American viewer) played by a mustache-twirly Sheila Hancock.</p>

<p>Most of this is really good, though some late Sylvester clowning
nearly sinks the whole affair. Creepy clowns galore! And a definite Mad
Max vibe to the waste land in which the Doctor and Ace find
themselves.</p>

<p>The final season of the series has its ups and downs, but continues

<h2>Ghost Light - Watch</h2>

<p>A strange, incomprehensible Victorian tale which reveals important

companion arc. I’m probably not selling it well, but it’s
entertaining!</p>

acting from McCoy, and Ace gets to show some range.</p>
