  <h1 class="title">Doctor Who - skip/watch list for classic Who</h1>
</div>
<div id="season-1-william-hartnell"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</h1>
<p>This is a show trying to find its feet. Is it an ensemble show, or is
the main character the mysterious man billed in the credits (really) as
“Dr. Who”? Is it an educational children’s history show or a scifi
horror drama? It’s all of those things! So many classic moments which
still work, from the first scenes in An Unearthly Child to the grim
moral dilemma of The Aztecs. If you’re up for it, it’s also totally
possible to start the show at the beginning.</p>
</div>
<div id="an-unearthly-child---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>An Unearthly Child - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>I’d watch the first (superb) episode of the serial - which is eerie
and strange - The Twilight Zone meets Narnia, but the rest is very
cheesy and painfully dated. Skip all of that and go on to good
stuff.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-daleks---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Daleks - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A decent introduction to the Doctor’s most iconic enemies. There’s a
lot of filler later on though. If I were being honest, this is more of a
“maybe,” but from a history-of-the-show viewpoint, it is iconic. If
nothing else, watch the unsettling first Dalek cliffhanger and the
brutal first full appearance of the monsters.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-edge-of-destruction---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Edge of Destruction - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A tight, paranoid 45 minute drama inside the TARDIS - worth seeing.
This is also a turning point for the Doctor, who until this point has
been cold and withdrawn.</p>
<p>All of this seven-episode serial is lost, which is a terrible shame -
the reconstructed version makes it seem like this would have been
visually spectacular. The story itself is interesting and epic in scope,
but it meanders in the middle and ultimately, not enough happens to
justify its length (or at least, not enough to seek out a
reconstruction).</p>
<p>Not bad - a sequence of adventures from Terry Nation - but not
exactly great either. A filler episode.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-aztecs---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Aztecs - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A really terrific, fascinating historical episode which lets the
characters sink their teeth into some solid drama. Do we have a right to
interfere in history? Barbara takes it on herself to try. Best of the
First Doctor, in my humble opinion.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-sensorites---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Sensorites - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A few nice moments, but it’s largely tedious and too long. Do,
however, watch Susan give us our first description of the Time Lords’
home planet. And here’s a nice scene as the group reflect on their
adventures.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-reign-of-terror-episodes-4---5-missing---maybe"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Reign of Terror (episodes 4 - 5 missing) - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 1 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>If you’re willing to endure a few reconstructed episodes, this is a
good, dark serial where our heroes have to stay alive in the French
Revolution. The Doctor ponces about in a plumed hat, which is worth the
price of admission. It inspired this tweet, which I’m proud of.</p>
</div>

<div id="season-2-william-hartnell"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</h1>
<p>The second season is a bit more pedestrian, but still has fine
moments. The TARDIS team have bonded and William Hartnell is much more
avuncular and twinkly in the lead role.</p>
</div>
<div id="planet-of-giants---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Planet of Giants - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A fun, short (no pun intended) adventure where the team get
miniaturized and has to thwart an evil plot.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-dalek-invasion-of-earth---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Dalek Invasion of Earth - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>Kind of overrated, but full of iconic visuals, and the last scene is
rightly considered one of the First Doctor’s best, as he delivers a
speech for all time. No, I’m not going to link to it - go watch the
episode.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-rescue---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Rescue - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A middling, short story which introduces companion, Vicki. There’s
nothing here that’s unmissable.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-romans---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Romans - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>It’s a fun, dorky historical and Ian spends a lot of time in a toga,
so it comes highly recommended from me. Also the First Doctor
accidentally ends up swept up on a journey that leads him to the court
of Nero himself where he has to engage in “the gentle art of
fisticuffs.” Clearly, the Doctor is starting to take a more proactive
role in the story.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-web-planet---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Web Planet - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>It’s not awful, but between some really weird stylistic choices
(Vaseline on the camera lens?) and a fairly slow plot, it’s pretty
skippable. I do love the weird character designs and movements, though -
props for ambition, ambition for props.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-crusade-episodes-2-4-missing---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Crusade (episodes 2 &amp; 4 missing) - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A terrific historical, which is compelling despite the two missing
episodes. Julian Glover guest stars as Richard the Lionheart and Jean
Marsh as his sister Joanna - the two have extraordinary chemistry. It
all just works.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-space-museum---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Space Museum - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>Not super memorable. Neat idea, but it doesn’t go anywhere.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-chase---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Chase - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>Character goodbyes probably make this adventure worth watching -
farewell, Ian and Barbara…(if you skip, here’s their exit, which you
definitely need to see.)</p>
</div>
<div id="the-time-meddler---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Time Meddler - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 2 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A bit slow, but this is the first Time Lord we meet who isn’t related
to the Doctor (and with his own TARDIS), so that’s pretty cool. It’s a
neat medieval milieu as well.</p>
</div>

<div id="season-3-william-hartnell"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</h1>
<p>An uneven season which grows stronger as it progresses, and shoots
for the moon with the ambitious epic The Daleks’ Master Plan. The Doctor
really starts to contemplate his losses and the weight of his traveling.
Hartnell is also much stronger here - his health is still not what it
was, but he’s certainly not flubbing lines as often as he was in season
2.</p>
</div>
<div id="galaxy-4-episodes-1---2-4-missing---skip"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>Galaxy 4 (episodes 1 - 2 &amp; 4 missing) - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>While there are some really good moments in the second and third
episode (plot reversals! dramatic dream sequences!), it’s just not worth
it for the long periods waiting for robots - “Chumblies” - to trundle
across the ground.</p>
</div>
<div id="mission-to-the-unknown-missing---maybe"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>Mission to the Unknown (missing) - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>This one filler episode was created to set up The Daleks’ Master Plan
and give viewers something to watch while all the main cast are on
vacation. The original is missing but some fans remade it, and you can
watch it here. </p>
</div>
<div id="the-myth-makers-all-episodes-missing---skip"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Myth Makers (all episodes missing) - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>Just kill me now. This story was probably pretty entertaining when it
could be seen, as the Doctor gets mistaken for Zeus at the siege of Troy
and that had to be fun, but it’s a chore to listen to tons and tons of
exposition in still pictures. The third episode picks up a bit, but it’s
all too brief. It also helps to be familiar with Greek mythology - or
rather, Shakespeare - as it turns out (spoiler!) Cressida and Diomedes
were actually Vicki and Steven. Vicki - I mean, Cressida - ends up
falling for Troilus and that’s how she leaves the TARDIS. Meanwhile,
Trojan maid Katarina joins the TARDIS team.</p>
</div>
<div
id="the-daleks-master-plan---episodes-1-3---4-6---9-and-11---12-missing---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Daleks’ Master Plan - (episodes 1, 3 - 4, 6 - 9, and 11 - 12
missing) - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A dark, immense tale which does what The Chase wanted to do, but
better. It’s a bit bloated, but it also doesn’t shy away from some real
consequences for the Doctor, and William Hartnell has seldom been
better. A magnificent epic. Do, however, skip The Feast of Steven, which
is a Christmas filler episode that my sister aptly described as “one
long headache.”</p>
</div>
<div
id="the-massacre-of-st-bartholomews-eve-all-episodes-missing---maybe"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Massacre of St Bartholomew’s Eve (all episodes missing) -
Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>The story’s a little bit hard to follow in a reconstruction, but the
ending is serious and thoughtful, as Steven grapples with the realities
of non-interference in history. If nothing else, you have to watch that
ending, which is really excellent drama - and which melds into a
Hartnell monologue with near David Tennant levels of Doctor Pathos. Also
- hahahaha - he totally kidnaps Dodo because she reminds him of
Susan.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-ark---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Ark - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A dorky time travel adventure that originates several important scifi
ideas that will pop up in the show again.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-celestial-toymaker-episodes-1---3-missing---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Celestial Toymaker (episodes 1 - 3 missing) - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>A gonzo ride into the mind of the Celestial Toymaker, a god who
forces his captives - in this case, the Doctor, Steven, and Dodo - to
play a series of nonsense games or be trapped in his universe for
eternity. It’s interesting and, for those days, high concept. Slightly
overrated, yes (season 6’s The Mind Robber is the platonic ideal of this
type of tale), but it’s a neat story.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-gunfighters---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Gunfighters - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>Here’s the thing - you get to see daffy old William Hartnell get
mistaken for Doc Holliday in Tombstone. But on the other hand, it’s too
long and they repeat the earworm theme song every three minutes. I don’t
know, I rather liked it. It’s part of the First Doctor Experience.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-savages-all-episodes-missing---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Savages (all episodes missing) - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>Alas, there’s nothing left of this episode, which is a shame, because
it’s an interesting morality tale in which the Doctor gets to be
thunderingly righteous in the aid of an oppressed minority people. He
even talks about human beings in terms of souls, which makes his
argument all the stronger.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-war-machines---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The War Machines - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 3 (William Hartnell)</sub></p>
<p>The last complete Hartnell episode. It’s an okay story, introducing
new companions Ben and Polly and providing an exit for Dodo Chaplet.
Kind of forgettable otherwise, though. Polly is the best female
companion we’ve had since Barbara. Watch her meet Ben here, to get an
idea of their personalities.</p>
</div>

<div id="season-4-william-hartnell-and-patrick-troughton"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 4 (William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton)</h1>
<p>It’s happening! William Hartnell’s increasingly frail health prompts
the BBC to find a way to recast the lead in their hit series.
Remarkably, instead of casting a William Hartnell lookalike, they decide
to go with Patrick Troughton, an impish little man with a Beatles moptop
and a twinkle in his eye that may be friendly or may be cunning. He’s
certainly not the man we knew, and he’s not interested in holding our
hand through the craziness of the first regeneration.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-smugglers-all-episodes-missing---skip"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Smugglers (all episodes missing) - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 4 (William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>A rote historical episode in which nothing of note occurs. If you
want, you can watch the first scene, where Polly and Ben realize they’ve
accidentally ended up on an adventure through time and space (and it
really was an accident, instead of the usual kidnapping! Character
development!)</p>
</div>
<div id="the-tenth-planet-episode-4-missing---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Tenth Planet (episode 4 missing) - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 4 (William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>Not the most exciting plot, but it’s the introduction of a key
villain (man, their design here is so much better than the new series)
and the occasion of the first regeneration. I’d say essential, but since
it’s harder to get a hold of, I guess not. Still, it’s a big moment in
the show’s history.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-power-of-the-daleks-all-episodes-missing---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Power of the Daleks (all episodes missing) - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 4 (William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>It’s worth watching a reconstruction (I always prefer the fan-made
versions, cobbled together from BBC telesnaps, instead of animated
versions), as this one’s a classic. Patrick Troughton is a zany,
alienating, unpredictable version of the man we knew as the Doctor. He
may be good, but is he safe?</p>
</div>
<div id="the-highlanders-all-episodes-missing---skip"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Highlanders (all episodes missing) - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 4 (William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>The Doctor is still attempting to find himself, which translates to
dressing up every chance he gets, putting on silly accents, and coveting
a selection of hats. The main important thing which occurs in this
episode is the introduction of new companion, Jamie McCrimmon, but
otherwise, it’s a bit of a snoozefest.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-underwater-menace-episodes-1-4-missing---skip"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Underwater Menace (episodes 1 &amp; 4 missing) - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 4 (William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>There are a few fun bits with Patrick Troughton mugging in funny hats
with his recorder, but it’s slow. Really slow. Check out this famously
corny line delivery so you will get the memes.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-moonbase-episodes-1-3-missing---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Moonbase (episodes 1 &amp; 3 missing) - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 4 (William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>A taut (and in Classic Who, that word hardly ever gets used)
base-under-siege episode and one of the best episodes for this iconic
villain. A fine Polly episode too. Troughton has found his Doctor.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-macra-terror-all-episodes-missing---skip"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Macra Terror (all episodes missing) - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 4 (William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>The Doctor and company land in a utopian society that - you won’t be
shocked - turns out to be not so utopian after all. Despite all the
decadence on display, there’s clearly a dark secret undergirding this
paradise, and the Doctor is determined to find out what it is. This is
kinda quirky and intriguing, but despite the genuinely memorable monster
and some cool atmosphere, it doesn’t end up going anywhere.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-faceless-ones-episodes-2-4-5-6-missing---maybe"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Faceless Ones (episodes 2, 4, 5 &amp; 6 missing) - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 4 (William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>The Doctor investigates a murder mystery at an airport. It’s fine.
The aliens have an interesting motivation for stealing “faces.” It’s
mostly notable for how it shows the developing relationship between
Patrick Troughton and Frazer Hines - they make a terrific double act.
But Polly and Ben barely feel involved, ironically - as it’s their last
episode. If nothing else, watch the final scene.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-evil-of-the-daleks-episodes-1-3---7-missing---maybe"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Evil of the Daleks (episodes 1, 3 - 7 missing) - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 4 (William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>An interesting episode which starts to introduce a more complex side
to the Daleks, and showcases the Second Doctor’s more manipulative side.
It features one terrific showdown between Troughton and the Daleks which
is worth watching, but the rest of it isn’t really worth the slog
through reconstructions.</p>
</div>

<div id="season-5-patrick-troughton"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 5 (Patrick Troughton)</h1>
<p>Finally, some complete Patrick Troughton episodes! Let’s be honest,
you probably didn’t slog through the previous almost-entirely-missing
season, so this season is probably your introduction to the man, the
myth, the legend. He’s firmly established in the character by now, with
a wonderful rapport with his definitive companion, 18th Century
highlander, Jamie McCrimmon. A great season, introducing a handful of
new monsters, though it ends with a clunker.   # The Tomb of the
Cybermen - Watch</p>
<p>A terrific Cyberman story with some truly funny and charming moments.
Its only downside is an unfortunately stereotyped African strongman.
Still, the first fully complete Patrick Troughton episode shows him at
the height of his charms alongside his best companion, Jamie. We get a
magical “bigger on the inside” scene and one of Troughton’s greatest
monologues. We’re reminded that the Doctor is ancient and mysterious -
but also relatable.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-abominable-snowmen-episodes-1-3---6-missing---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Abominable Snowmen (Episodes 1 &amp; 3 - 6 missing) - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 5 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>A strong adventure set in the Himalayas with a well-developed
supporting cast and a mysterious new villain. Victoria really starts to
show some spunk here, redeeming herself after her damsel in distress act
in Tomb of the Cybermen. Check out Josh Snares terrific reconstructions
of episode one, three, and four.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-ice-warriors-episodes-2---3-missing---skip"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Ice Warriors (Episodes 2 - 3 missing) - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 5 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>A lot of this episode works, with Peter Sallis turning in a
particularly good supporting performance. The Ice Warriors, however, are
so slow and sinister that they end up becoming a bit boring, and
Victoria is back to her old screamer ways (seriously, one week she’s
Sarah Jane, the next Mel Bush). The episode is also prone towards
preaching on and on about the evils of computers - we know, we get
it.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-enemy-of-the-world---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Enemy of the World - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 5 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>The Doctor meets his evil doppelganger in this spy thriller. It’s
really fun and lets Patrick Troughton flex. Who does Bond. It was lost
for decades, but was one of the two serials - the other is The Web of
Fear - discovered in Nigeria. Pause a moment and appreciate that - after
decades, a lost Doctor Who episode turned up in Africa and just happened
to be a classic. Actually, both of them are classics. What a wonderful
world.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-web-of-fear-episode-3-missing---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Web of Fear (Episode 3 missing) - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 5 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>A terrific episode set in the London underground - the Yeti are a bit
cheesy, but features the introduction of a super-important recurring
character, and it’s a great episode for atmosphere. Another great
Victoria episode, too.</p>
</div>
<div id="fury-from-the-deep-all-episodes-missing---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>Fury from the Deep (All episodes missing) - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 5 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>This was the final serial I watched (well, “watched”) and I must say,
it was an excellent note to go out on. Riveting, unsettling, and quickly
paced, this is the rare reconstruction which kept me on the edge of my
seat throughout (I watched Loose Canon’s reconstruction but I might
actually look into getting the animated version). In addition to all its
other charms, it has a great emotional arc for Victoria as she starts to
decide she’s had enough of the TARDIS life.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-wheel-in-space-episodes-1---2-4---5-missing---skip"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Wheel in Space (Episodes 1 - 2 &amp; 4 - 5 missing) - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 5 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>It’s the introduction of young genius companion Zoe Heriot, but
there’s not enough here to make it worth watching. You do get this line:
“Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with authority.” And
Jamie coins the Doctor’s long-time alias, John Smith. Here’s Zoe meeting
the Doctor. And the Doctor welcomes Zoe on board with a little pleasant
hazing. Both of those clips are good to watch, and if you were wondering
how Jamie was taking Victoria’s exit, here’s a reconstruction of that
scene.</p>
</div>

<div id="season-6-patrick-troughton"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 6 (Patrick Troughton)</h1>
<p>Troughton’s final season is a mixed bag, but when it’s great, it’s
incredible. Iconic moments abound and the season pushes the show’s
mythology towards truly incredible heights.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-dominators---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Dominators - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 6 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>Meh. Truly awful costumes. Quite forgettable story. Frazer Hines and
Patrick Troughton are funny, but sometimes somebody needed to remind
them to take the show seriously.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-mind-robber---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Mind Robber - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 6 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>My all-time favorite Classic Who episode. Very strange and meta,
questioning the very fabric of the show itself. Insanely ambitious and
ahead of its time - the episode tends to split audiences, but its whimsy
(some may claim “silliness”) is bolstered by boundless creativity and
smart plotting. A true Hall of Fame episode.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-invasion-episodes-1-4-missing---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Invasion (Episodes 1 &amp; 4 missing) - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 6 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>A fun thriller set in London - lots of important plot elements start
lining up for the third Doctor’s era. Return of Alistair
Lethbridge-Stewart, intro of Benton and UNIT, and the super iconic shot
of Cybermen at a famous location. Not strictly essential, but there’s so
much here that will turn up later that you really need to watch it.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-krotons---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Krotons - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 6 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>Really quite a bad episode. Dull and unmemorable.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-seeds-of-death---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Seeds of Death - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 6 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>A fun futuristic episode, introducing yet another key villain.
Fantastic set design. It features what may be Patrick Troughton’s most
iconic line (and line reading).</p>
</div>
<div id="the-space-pirates-episodes-1-3---6-missing---skip"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Space Pirates (Episodes 1, 3 - 6 missing) - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 6 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>Robert Holmes’s second episode does not live up to the heights to
which he will eventually rise as a writer. It’s supposed to be about
pirates! Not the boring personal drama between a man who looks like he
walked right out of a TV Western and the daughter of his rival! Or
something! Boring.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-war-games---essential" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The War Games - Essential</h1>
<p><sub>Season 6 (Patrick Troughton)</sub></p>
<p>The second Doctor’s swan song, an ambitious epic which sometimes
feels like Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory (I’m not kidding - and in
fact, to my delight, I once observed as much to Frazer Hines). Overlong,
but packs a real emotional punch, and introduces a ton of the show’s
mythology. Patrick Troughton has never been better.</p>

<div id="season-7-jon-pertwee" class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 7 (Jon Pertwee)</h1>
<p>The Third Doctor’s first season brings Doctor Who into the marvelous
world of color.  Jon Pertwee was primarily a comic actor, so it came as
a surprise to everyone (including him, a bit) when he played the role ”
as himself,” drawing on his background as a Naval Intelligence operative
during the war. He’s supported by a marvelous cast, including Nicholas
Courtenay as Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart (if you liked
Kate Stewart in New Who, this is her dad.) While I love the gentler side
he shows in later seasons, Pertwee may be at his best in his first
outing, still showing the immaturity and unpredictability which
characterized his predecessor’s “trickster” persona.</p>
</div>
<div id="spearhead-from-space---essential" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Spearhead from Space - Essential</h1>
<p><sub>Season 7 (Jon Pertwee)</sub></p>
<p>The first episode, due to a strike, was shot on location and entirely
on film instead of tape which means it looks fantastic, even now. It’s
also a really great regeneration episode (topped only by The Eleventh
Hour, in my opinion) which introduces the Doctor’s new milieu and sets
up the supporting cast who will anchor the show for its earthbound
years.</p>

<p>The Third Doctor’s second season isn’t quite as experimental,

<p>A cheesy, fun adventure set in a pastoral village. Doctor Who meets

best UNIT story ever) and the Doctor seems to finally have accepted his
place on Earth. Also, the introduction of the Third Doctor’s
catchphrase!</p>

<p>A weaker season, though Pertwee is always charming.</p>
<p>Day of the Daleks - Maybe - What could have been a middling story is

<div id="season-10-jon-pertwee"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 10 (Jon Pertwee)</h1>
<p>The show arrives at its tenth anniversary, with a season more
inventive than the previous one. We get our first multi-Doctor story and
the show starts to gravitate back towards a more traditional
travel-oriented premise. Still, the show is beginning to a feel a little
comfortable with itself - the Tom Baker shot in the arm that it needs is
still a season away.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-three-doctors---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Three Doctors - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 10 (Jon Pertwee)</sub></p>
<p>One should never skip multi-Doctor episodes, and this one is a

my favorite overall. Pertwee and Troughton are a wonderful double act,
though it’s a shame William Hartnell was too ill to contribute very
much.</p>
</div>
<div id="carnival-of-monsters---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Carnival of Monsters - Watch</h1>

<div id="frontier-in-space---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Frontier in Space - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 10 (Jon Pertwee)</sub></p>
<p>The first half’s rather dull, but then the Master turns up and gives
an excellent, and sadly, final performance (Roger Delgado would die soon
after in a car accident in Turkey). He’s in league with…the Uruk Hai?
Sorry, Ogrons.</p>
</div>
<div id="planet-of-the-daleks---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Planet of the Daleks - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 10 (Jon Pertwee)</sub></p>
<p>There are nice reflective moments here - Pertwee gives a nice speech
to a side character about bravery. Jo Grant is more proactive. But too
much of it is spent with the Doctor or Jo sidelined for plot reasons
(he’s in a coma - but when he wakes up, he takes the time to switch
clothes before dealing with the immediate crisis) and the non-Dalek
villains clearly suffered from a lack of budget (they’re invisible). An
underbaked side romance for Jo just makes the story feel all the more
Who-by-the-numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-green-death---essential" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Green Death - Essential</h1>
<p><sub>Season 10 (Jon Pertwee)</sub></p>
<p>Okay, it’s cheesy and preachy and…well, the monsters are actually
pretty gross…but you have to see Jo Grant’s exit. It has real pathos,
and has one of the best performances Pertwee ever gave.</p>
</div>

<div id="season-11-jon-pertwee"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 11 (Jon Pertwee)</h1>
<p>A new companion! Pertwee and Elizabeth Sladen have some great moments
in this season (The Time Warrior is one for the ages), but it’s clear
the UNIT years have run out of steam. Behind the scenes, Pertwee had
decided that he didn’t want to go on without Delgado or Katy Manning, so
this season feels a bit like it’s treading water before an inevitable
exit.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-time-warrior---watch" class="slide section level2">

</div>
<div id="invasion-of-the-dinosaurs---watch"

</div>
<div id="planet-of-the-spiders---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Planet of the Spiders - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 11 (Jon Pertwee)</sub></p>
<p>Some really cringey character and design moments in this, but it’s a
regeneration story, so you kind of have to watch it (I’m just so annoyed
by the cringey stuff that I don’t have it as “watch.”) Pertwee’s final
moments are touching. We get a little more closure for Mike Yates.  </p>
</div>

<div id="season-12-tom-baker" class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 12 (Tom Baker)</h1>
<p>Tom Baker arrives in a blaze of glory. He has great companions, great
writing, an incredible wardrobe, charisma out the wazoo - Baker really
had all the luck. It’s for those reasons that I often suggest starting
with Baker, because this was the golden moment when the show was firing

realize that the robot itself is extremely clunky and unimpressive, even

<p>Tom Baker and Sarah Jane return for a second season. Harry Sullivan,
alas, doesn’t make it beyond episode one, as they’d realized that with a

Sarah Jane is clearly becoming more proactive, the Doctor has some real

<p>While overrated, there are some brilliant inventions here. The Doctor
goes toe-to-toe with a mysterious Gothic villain (and his henchman, in
unfortunate and dreadful yellowface prosthetics). Showman Henry Gordon
Jago and pathologist George Litefoot are terrific. If you enjoy those
two, you should check out their Big Finish spin-off series, Jago and
Litefoot, where they investigate paranormal and supernatural phenomena
in Victorian England. The first five seasons of the show are currently
available for free on Spotify. It’s easily the best Doctor Who spinoff.
I adore it.</p>

<h1>Season 19 (Peter Davison)</h1>
<p>Peter Davison had the unenviable task of following the wildly popular
Tom Baker. He does so admirably, with a fey and amiable lightness of
touch dramatically at odds with Baker’s vain showboating. Unfortunately,
the writers don’t always know what to do with Davison’s new approach,
but when the episode gives him the opportunity, he can be great.</p>

<div id="castrovalva---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Castrovalva - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 19 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>Essential, a new type of regeneration story. It’s easy to see the

throwbacks are nice.</p>

<p>Nothing happens in this one.</p>

<h1>Kinda - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 19 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>A weird hallucinogenic adventure. Pretty well-regarded, but I wasn’t
crazy about it.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-visitation---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Visitation - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 19 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>A solid historical with some great Davison Doctor moments. I know

</div>
<div id="black-orchid---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Black Orchid - Maybe</h1>

<h1>Earthshock - Essential</h1>
<p><sub>Season 19 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>You’ll see why when you’ve finished. A really serious twist makes the

this? Davison gets some great moments too.</p>
</div>
<div id="time-flight---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Time-Flight - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 19 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>Deathly dull. Read the summary to figure out the one important plot
development, but only if you’re planning to watch the next episode.</p>
</div>

<div id="season-20-peter-davison"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 20 (Peter Davison)</h1>
<p>An odd season, but one which features a fantastic arc with new
companion, Turlough. There’s fan service, but it’s understated, and it’s
not afraid to push the limits of what’s possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="arc-of-infinity---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Arc of Infinity - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 20 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>A weird Time Lord adventure in which we see the return of an old
villain. They’re on location in Amsterdam, which is neat, and a plot
point from Time-Flight is undone, but if neither of those things is all
that important to you, skip it. </p>
</div>
<div id="snakedance---maybe" class="slide section level2">

<h1>Mawdryn Undead - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 20 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>It’s a bit slow, but it features the return of the Brigadier, so it’s
unmissable. It begins the Black Guardian trilogy, which focuses on new
companion, Turlough.</p>
</div>
<div id="terminus---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Terminus - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 20 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>

</div>
<div id="enlightenment---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Enlightenment - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 20 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>A really terrific conclusion to the trilogy. Strikingly realized art

episodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-kings-demons---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The King’s Demons - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 20 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>A rather mediocre historical featuring The Mastahhhh. It explains the
origin of Kamelion, but do you really need to know that? Nope.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-five-doctors---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Five Doctors - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 20 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>It’s the return of some familiar faces, but it’s really uneventful
and not as good as The Three Doctors.</p>

<div id="season-21-peter-davison"

<p>Peter Davison’s final season grows stronger as it goes, though it’s

</div>
<div id="warriors-of-the-deep---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Warriors of the Deep - Skip</h1>

though.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-awakening---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Awakening - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 21 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>I remember nothing about this one.</p>
<p>Frontios - Maybe - The Doctor and company visit a planet where the
human population is just holding onto survival. The plot is nothing to
write home about, but some of the Fifth Doctor’s best lines appear here.
“Tell them I came and went like a summer cloud.”</p>
</div>
<div id="resurrection-of-the-daleks---maybe"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>Resurrection of the Daleks - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 21 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>On the one hand, it’s got some cool moments but all in all, it just
doesn’t amount to much except a lot of death. It’s so violent, in fact,
that it results in this final scene, which you should watch. As
companion exits go, it’s not bad.</p>
</div>
<div id="planet-of-fire---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Planet of Fire - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 21 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>The end of Turlough’s story, the intro of a new companion, and a
pretty good episode.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-caves-of-androzani---essential"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Caves of Androzani - Essential</h1>
<p><sub>Season 21 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>Essential, also a highly respected, ghoulishly dark episode ending
Peter Davison’s tenure in the TARDIS. There are parts of it that don’t
work for me (some of the fourth-wall-breaking is kinda cringe and I’d
give a lot to have literally any other companion accompany the Fifth
Doctor to his doom), but the iconography of the ending is
extraordinary.</p>
</div>
<div id="twin-dilemma---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Twin Dilemma - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 21 (Peter Davison)</sub></p>
<p>A truly dreadful opening episode for Colin Baker’s benighted TV run
as the Doctor. Yes, it has some hilariously bombastic moments from the
pompous Sixth Doctor, but the episode itself is painful. Be kind to
yourself and skip. Maybe watch his first scene, though, just because
Colin is clearly having a lot of fun with it.</p>
</div>

<div id="season-22-colin-baker"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 22 (Colin Baker)</h1>
<p>All right, we need to talk about the Sixth Doctor. He’s flamboyant
and arrogant and unlike any other Doctor and I love him. His tenure on
the show featured a dreadful run of episodes, and he starts off with the
worst companion of all time, bumbling “American” Peri Brown. But he
manages to thoroughly redeem himself in the audio world of Big Finish.
I’ll return to that at the end of this section.</p>
</div>
<div id="attack-of-the-cybermen---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Attack of the Cybermen - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 22 (Colin Baker)</sub></p>
<p>Less painful than some Baker stories, but not terribly inventive. A
ton of throwbacks, which are kind of random but fun. There is an
intensity here that might make it worth watching, and the Doctor fixes
the chameleon circuit!</p>
</div>
<div id="vengeance-on-varos---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Vengeance on Varos - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 22 (Colin Baker)</sub></p>
<p>If you want to see at least one Colin Baker story, this one is an
interesting and grim satire of reality TV that, if not great, is at
least a good episode in the era’s style. Doctor Who does The Hunger
Games, sorta? But even grimmer. I enjoyed the story, even if I think its
sensibilities are not really Doctor Who-ish.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-mark-of-the-rani---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Mark of the Rani - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 22 (Colin Baker)</sub></p>
<p>This has nice bits - it has some good locations and gets Colin out of
the rainbow suit, which is nice. It brings back the Master and
introduces a new female villain: the Rani. But it’s mostly
forgettable.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-two-doctors---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Two Doctors - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 22 (Colin Baker)</sub></p>
<p>Oh dear, where to start? It’s horrifying watching poor whimsical
Patrick Troughton forced into the grimdark circus that is the Colin
Baker years, but at the same time, it’s Patrick Troughton. He’s back!
With Jamie! Which is delightful! But what a waste!</p>
</div>
<div id="timelash---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Timelash - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 22 (Colin Baker)</sub></p>
<p>Widely considered the worst Who story of all time….an opinion with
which I disagree, (I tend to prefer bad to boring) but it is, of course,
absolutely dreadful.</p>
</div>
<div id="revelation-of-the-daleks---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Revelation of the Daleks - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 22 (Colin Baker)</sub></p>
<p>I almost went with “maybe” for this one. The plot is not that great,
but it looks fantastic. Classic Who’s best director, Graeme Harper,
returns with moving cameras and pleasing color and mise en scène. But
the first episode sidelines the Doctor and Peri for so long that the
story seems like it takes forever to get anywhere. Colin Baker’s Doctor
is gentler here. Still, is it worth it? Probably not.</p>
<p> Season 23 (Colin Baker)</p>
<p>For Colin Baker’s second season, the writers decided to try for an
extremely experimental approach: one massive story framed by a trial.
The Doctor is on trial before the Time Lords, accused of genocide - the
first three episode are retrospective pieces of evidence presented by
the prosecution. All in all, the four episodes are known as Trial of a
Timelord:</p>
<p>The Mysterious Planet, Mindwarp, Terror of the Vervoids, and The
Ultimate Foe.</p>
<p>Skip, Watch, or Maybe? This is tough. It’s a weird and high concept
series that still has some but not all of the problems of the previous
season. The Doctor is kinder. It’s an interesting, twisty plot - but it
does still have a lot of the same pitfalls, and I don’t point to any
part of it as definitively great. I’m gonna go with Maybe.  </p>
<p>Here’s where I’m going to stop you and explain why I love the Sixth
Doctor so much. After the show was cancelled, a group of fans formed Big
Finish, a company which produced audio dramas set in the world of Doctor
Who. They turned in some of the most wonderful story-telling the show’s
world has received, and much of it influenced (and is still referenced
in) the revived show (remember the Eighth Doctor listing his companions?
That was Big Finish.) I recommend you head over to Spotify now and start
with The Marian Conspiracy, a wonderful introduction to his most
wonderful of companions, elderly history teacher Evelyn Smythe.</p>
<p>Colin’s final story is The Last Adventure, in which he battles the
Valeyard. On the original show, Colin was fired and so Sylvester McCoy
regenerated with an obscured face and a blond wig. But The Last
Adventure ends with a re-written regeneration, segueing smoothly into
the opening of the next episode. Many fans have made animated versions
of that scene from the audio drama, but this deepfake one is the best,
giving Colin, finally, a decent send-off. (If you want something a bit
funnier, try this.)</p>
</div>

<div id="season-24-sylvester-mccoy"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 24 (Sylvester McCoy)</h1>
<p>Sylvester McCoy starts off with an absolute dump of a season. You can
probably skip to the next season safely, but check out the final scene
of Dragonfire, below.</p>
</div>
<div id="time-and-the-rani---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Time and the Rani - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 24 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
<p>An embarrassment of an introductory episode. The best part is
Sylvester McCoy playing spoons, if that tells you anything.</p>
</div>
<div id="paradise-towers---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Paradise Towers - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 24 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
<p>I like parts of this. There are weird friendly cannibal ladies. And a
Tom Hiddleston lookalike. Oddly enough, it was based on a story which
was later remade as a film starring…Tom Hiddleston. The premise is okay.
But it’s all drenched in that terrible 80’s Who dreck and
over-acting.</p>
</div>
<div id="delta-and-the-bannermen---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Delta and the Bannermen - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 24 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
<p>Soooo this one is really weird and probably an episode most people
dislike, but I think it’s fun. The Doctor and Mel think they’re going to
1950s Disneyland, but they end up at a Welsh hotel which is the center
of a drama featuring several extraterrestrial visitors. It’s possible
that I liked it was because the rest of this season is dreadful, but
it’s the best of the early McCoy panto period for sure.</p>
</div>
<div id="dragonfire---skip" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Dragonfire - Skip</h1>
<p><sub>Season 24 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
<p>The main reason to watch this is that it’s the exit for Mel and the
entry point for the first really good companion we’ve had for ages: Ace
McShane. The episode’s not great, but Mel’s goodbye is very good. McCoy
delivers a touching speech. Watch the goodbye and the speech here.</p>
</div>

<div id="season-25-sylvester-mccoy"
class="title-slide slide section level1">
<h1>Season 25 (Sylvester McCoy)</h1>
<p>Finally! The downward trend begins to reverse itself. The Seventh
Doctor has a great new companion and a show which seems to remember its
history and its dignity. No more panto. Mostly.</p>
</div>
<div id="remembrance-of-the-daleks---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>Remembrance of the Daleks - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 25 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
<p>The show reinvents itself. We have a new companion, a new tone, and
we might as well have a new Doctor, as Sylvester McCoy reveals the
Doctor’s dark side. Sylvester McCoy said at a convention I attended that
he based this shift in portrayal on his grandmother who lived to over
100 - that “weariness” and age is something he tries to convey - and
succeeds beautifully.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-happiness-patrol---watch" class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Happiness Patrol - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 25 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
<p>I once saw a clip from this episode and was utterly horrified at the
depths of camp to which 80’s Doctor Who had sunk. But when I actually
got around to watching it…it’s good. The story is set in a futuristic,
fascist society where no one is allowed to be sad. There’s also…the
Kandy Man, who looks like a children’s show character, but who is, with
his high reedy voice and horrifying ways of killing people, an
unexpected success as a villain. So is Helen A. - the society’s dictator
(based on Margaret Thatcher, but that wasn’t obvious to me as a modern
American viewer) played by a mustache-twirly Sheila Hancock.</p>
</div>
<div id="silver-nemesis---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Silver Nemesis - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 25 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
<p>Corny, uneven, heavily incorporating elements of Arthurian legend

</div>
<div id="the-greatest-show-in-the-galaxy---watch"
class="slide section level2">
<h1>The Greatest Show in the Galaxy - Watch</h1>
<p><sub>Season 25 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
<p>Most of this is really good, though some late Sylvester clowning

Max vibe to the waste land in which the Doctor and Ace find
themselves.</p>

<h1>Season 26 (Sylvester McCoy)</h1>
<p>The final season of the series has its ups and downs, but continues
the trend of pushing the story in interesting directions. You can
definitely see concepts that will be picked up again in the revived
show, over a decade later.</p>
</div>
<div id="battlefield---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Battlefield - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 26 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
<p>Cons: It’s got a cheesy plot and villain. Pros: It’s the return of
the Brig. Do you need another pro?</p>
<p>Ghost Light - Watch - A strange, incomprehensible Victorian tale
which reveals important details about Ace’s past and clearly foreshadows
a more New Who-style companion arc. I’m probably not selling it well,
but it’s entertaining! </p>
<p>The Curse of Fenric - Watch - Zombies and Vikings and paradoxes, oh
my! This is a startling, dark story which continues the thread begun in
Ghost Light. Some excellent acting from McCoy, and Ace gets to show some
range.</p>
</div>
<div id="survival---maybe" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Survival - Maybe</h1>
<p><sub>Season 26 (Sylvester McCoy)</sub></p>
